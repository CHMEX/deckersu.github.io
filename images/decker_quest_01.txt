Decker's Quest--------------Find the hidden Komodo Gold. Rules are simple:1. This image contains two hidden secrets with 7.77 KMD each. First is the passphrase for use withAgama or Barterdex. Find it and get access for the prize.2. Second secret is a 32 bytes private key. If you find it and generate Komodo (0x3C Network Prefix) uncompressed address and WIF for it - you can obtain additional 7.77 KMD.3.
